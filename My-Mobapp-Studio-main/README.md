## Task

We are expecting two files:

First will be your notebook jupyter with your calculation You will have to implement multiple functions:

compute_correlations_matrix(dataset)
print_scatter_matrix()
Second will be a report. You will publish it on any blog platform of your choice.
To drive your Analysis:

Plot with bar diagram the most populars paid apps of Family category

Plot with a pie diagram the most popular genres according to the number of installations from paid family

## Description

The Google Play Store is the largest app market in the world.It generates more than double the downloads of the Apple App Store, but makes only half the money as the App Store.So, we scraped data from the Play Store to conduct research on it .There are a couple of issues with the Play Store that we have identified from exploratory data analysis. An inclusion of a feature that lets users notify developers if they are unsatisfied with an update could go a long into not plummeting an app with low installs to the ground. There is also the problem of rating mismatch on a smaller scale. If this issue could be mitigated, the Play Store would provide a more accurate representation of user sentiment which in turn could help developers make adjustments to their app accordingly. We also defined a success parameter for an app based on the number of installs, distribution of ratings 4 and 5 relative to the overall number of ratings, installs to rating ratio, content.
